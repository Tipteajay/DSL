Algorithm for Pizza Parlour Ordering System:

1. Create a class `PizzaParlour` with private members `front`, `rear`, and `orders` array of size `MAX`.
   - Initialize `front` and `rear` to -1.

2. Implement member functions in the class:
   a. `addOrder(int id)`: Add an order with a given order ID to the queue.
   b. `serveOrder()`: Serve the order at the front of the queue.
   c. `display()`: Display the order IDs in the queue.

3. Create a function `intro()` to display the name of the pizza parlour with a delay.

4. In the `main` function:
   a. Create an instance of the `PizzaParlour` class (`q`).
   b. Use a do-while loop to present a menu for the user:
      - Accept Order: Increment the order ID, add the order to the queue, and display the order ID.
      - Serve Order: Serve the order at the front of the queue.
      - Display Orders: Display the order IDs in the queue.
      - Exit: End the program.
   c. Continue the loop until the user chooses to exit.

5. Display a thank-you message.

6. End the program.
