Algorithm :

Algorithm for Sorting and Displaying Top Five Marks:

1. Initialize an empty list called `arr` to store the scores of students.

2. Input the number of students (`Num`):
 
3. Input scores for each student:
   - For each student (loop from 1 to `Num`):
  
4. Define a function `shellSort(arr)` for shell sort:

5. Define a function `insertion_sort(arr)` for insertion sort:
  
6. Define a function `top_five(arr)` to display the top five scores:
   - Print "Top five scores are:".
   - If the count of elements in `arr` is less than 5, set `start` and `stop` accordingly.
   - For each element in the range `[start, stop, -1)`, print the score.

7. Define a function `main()`:
   - Print the menu options.
   - Read the user's choice (`choice`) for sorting.
   - Perform the corresponding action based on the user's choice:
     
8. Call `main()` to start the program.
