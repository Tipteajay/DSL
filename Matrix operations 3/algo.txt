Algorithm:

1. Initialize Matrices:
Create two matrices x and y using NumPy arrays.

2. Element-wise Addition:
Use the numpy.add() function to perform element-wise addition of matrices x and y.
Print the result.

3. Matrix Multiplication:
Use the numpy.dot() function to compute the product of matrices x and y.
Print the result.

4. Transpose of Matrix:
Use the .T attribute to obtain the transpose of matrix x.
Print the result.
